# Energy-consumption-and-optimization-of-a-CNC-machine

This repository contains the Python code developed for a Master’s thesis focused on
the modelling, prediction, and optimization of energy consumption in CNC machining
operations.

The framework integrates G-code parsing, machine kinematics, and data-driven models
to estimate power consumption, processing time, cost, and environmental impact.
A web-based interface built with FastAPI allows users to upload CNC programs and
interactively evaluate machining performance under different operating conditions.
